// Package orgprovider models the external organization-data provider integration:
// the outcome of a sync, the fixed set of records a sync must never touch, and the
// persistence contract the infrastructure layer implements.
//
// There is deliberately no provider-ownership column anywhere in the schema (see
// docs/organization-snapshot-contract.md and the design discussion that preceded
// this package). Because "is this row provider-managed" cannot be answered by a
// database column, every user/team not explicitly protected below is treated as
// provider-managed: present in the provider's snapshot -> created/updated; absent -> a
// hard-delete candidate. The fixed allowlists in this file are what keeps that
// blanket assumption safe.
